---- Challenge 1 solutions----

NB: IN THE SOLUTION EXCLUDE ALL THE MALFORMED PACKETS

1) What are the differences between the request with MID: 53533 and the one with MID: 42804

The packet with MID 53533 is CONfirmable, the other one is NON confirmable. Moreover the first one is a GET request, the second one is a DELETE
Filter: coap.mid == 53533 || coap.mid==42804
So the answer should highlight the difference in both Type and Method



2) What is the response of message No. 2428, if any?

Take the frame, check the token and hence get the response -> “coap.token == 67:c7:22:9a”
The client receive as response the packet No. 2429 with code 2.02 Deleted 




3) How many replies to requests of type confirmable, having result code “Content” are received by the client “localhost”?

responses to CON messages can be of type ACK or CON!
ip.dst == 127.0.0.1 && coap.code == 69 && (coap.type == 2 || coap.type == 0)
Answer: 8




4) How many GET requests, excluding OBSERVE requests, have been directed to non existing resources?

Non existing resources means 4.04 not found response code (code 132)

Take only get requests excluding observe and search for GET - 4.04 pairs
(coap.code == 1 &&  !coap.opt.observe) || coap.code == 132
The filter shows only GET(no observe) requests and only 4.04 responses. Hence consider only the 4.04 corresponding to the displayed GETs

ANSWER: 6




5) How many messages containing the topic “factory/department*/+” are published by a client with user password: “admin”? Where * replaces only the dep. number [0-9], e.g. factory/department1/+, factory/department2/+ and so on. (btw, * is NOT an MQTT wildcard)

ZERO, no publishes match the topics. 
Remember that the + is a single-level wildcard (i.e. factory/department2/aaaaa, factory/department2/bbbbb) and factory/department2/aaaaa/1111/3333 is not valid). (tricky question btw)

So the answer is 0






6) How many clients connected to the public broker “mosquitto” have specified a will message?

	+ get the ip address related to mosquitto: dns.a && dns.qry.name == "test.mosquitto.org"
	+ (ip.dst == 5.196.95.208) && mqtt.conflag.willflag == 1

Clients with same id (e.g. empty id) but different ports should be counted as different clients
ANSWER: 9 clients






7) How many publishes with QoS 2 don’t receive the PUBREL? (NEXT YEAR SET THIS TO PUBCOMP OR PUBREC PLS)

with "mqtt.msgtype == 6" we take all the PUBREL (0)
hence all the qos2 publish did not receive the pubrel 
take all qos = 2 publish message with: "mqtt.qos==2 and mqtt.msgtype==2" -> 94 values
ANSWER: 94

Other possible solution: The publishers do not receive PUBREL but instead send it -> then the answer is still 94






8) What is the average Will Topic Length specified by clients with empty Client ID?

take connect packet and then filter by client id empty. Take the length of will topic there and take the mean
	filter: mqtt.clientid=="" and mqtt.conflag.willflag == 1  (37 packets or 22 depending on WS version) 

Mean will topic length: 37.05 or 37.77





9) How many ACKs received the client with ID "6M5H8y3HJD5h4EEscWknTD"? What type(s) is(are) it(them)?

take connect with mqtt.clientid=="6M5H8y3HJD5h4EEscWknTD" then follow the tcp stream
tcp.stream eq 281 && mqtt

TOTALLY 5 ACKS:      1 CONNACK      3 SUBACK      1 PUBACK

WARNING: the 3 SUBACK are all in a single packet





10) What is the average message length of the CONNECT messages using mqttv3.1 protocol? Why messages have different size?

filter: mqtt.msgtype==1 && mqtt.ver == 3
then take the mean of the MQTT Msg Len value (NOT the packet/frame length!)

ANSWER: 63.59
